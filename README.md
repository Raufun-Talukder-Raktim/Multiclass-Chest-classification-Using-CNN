# Multiclass-Chest-classification-Using-CNN
A task of CSE4238-Soft Computing Lab

This task was build with multi-layer CNN based deep learning model architecture for classifing three classes from Chest X-Ray images.

Three Classes were 

1. COVID19
2. Pneumonia
3. Normal

The model has been trained on the [COVID19+PNEUMONIA+NORMAL Chest X-Ray Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/covid-pneumonia-normal-chest-xray-images) from Kaggle. The dataset has been split into an *80: 10: 10* ratio for Train, Test, and Validation sets. On the Test set, this model achieves an accuracy of **97.8967%** and on validation set achieves an accuracy of **96.3671%**.
